<h4 id="synchronize-all-kind-of-data">Synchronize all kind of data</h4>
<p>Our goal is very simple, connect and synchronize your data between your apps, wherever they are, whatever they are.
Our approach is declarative, that is, it is the servers that you connect that define the data to be synchronized.</p>

<h4 id="fully-universal">Fully Universal</h4>
<p>Change the way you manage your apps in the cloud! Splash is a data connector unlike any other. Why? It is totally universal!!
Splash system is totally Universal and was not designed for any specific data type. All data types are treated the same way!</p>

<h4 id="participative-synchronization">Participative Synchronization</h4>
<p>By connecting your applications to Splash, you do not create direct connections between servers, you give them the ability to share their data with your entire network.</p>

<h4 id="automatic-routing">Automatic Routing</h4>
<p>Thanks to the field identification tags, your business data are automatically synchronized with all servers where they are available. No complex configuration, Splash do it for you!</p>

<h4 id="more-powerful-than-native-webservices">More powerful than native webservices</h4>
<p>The Splash module is not intended for a single application and can access structured and complex data formats. It provides easy access to all types of data.</p>

<h4 id="more-efficient">More efficient</h4>
<p>By favoring a “module” approach, Splash does not supplant the rest of the application. This will take care of the specific rules for each application.</p>
